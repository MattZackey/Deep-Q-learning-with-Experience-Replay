# Q-learning-with-Cartpole

The following is an example of applying Q-learning to the Cart Pole environment from OpenAI gymnasium. The theory in this project is from the paper: [Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.5602.pdf). Note that the only difference in this project is that a soft target update was used to update the [target network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.02971.pdf?source=post_page---------------------------). The soft target update was found to improve learning speed.
